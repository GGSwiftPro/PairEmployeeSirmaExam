# EmployeePair Console App for Sirma Academy's final exam

This application is reading employee and projects from single CSV file and the main function is finding the pair that worked together the most for a project and the amount of time
The project should be able to run by itself with nothing more to be downloaded except intelij and java
The project is started from the main file and on the console u can type which option u want to use
I had some ussues with update and add client but mostly fixed them. Hopefully it all works well now.
Thanks for the time and effort going through my code!
